Lets [Learn C the Hard Way](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/).  Thanks to Zed Shaw and his book series on learning code the hard way, they provide great tutorials and resources to learn python, ruby, c as well as other topics. 

Lets try our hands at C.  This book ain't no K & R, but it looks like a worthy way to learn the 1970's foundational language for a lot of other langs and OS's.
